# PhoenixHeadTracker
The Phoenix Head Tracker is a program that interfaces with Nreal Air glasses to capture and analyze sensor data. By detecting changes in the user's head yaw and pitch, this program controls the movement of the computer mouse on screen(Not implemented yet), creating an intuitive and unique user interface.

# How to use
Connect your Nreal Air glasses to your PC using the USB-Type C connector. Start Phoenix Head Tracker and click on 'Connect Nreal Air'. Wait 5+ seconds for the sensors to adjust. Then use the sliders to match the 'Raw Yaw' to 'Match Yaw' and 'Raw Pitch' to 'Match Pitch'.
